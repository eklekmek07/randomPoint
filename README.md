# randomPoint
It is a fun project, I mean literally fun. Yet, someday, it will be a engine for my own(eklekmek07) tablegame(that does not exist for know) and my trader game(which is exist but does not work properly)

Project start with a idea that can we create random dots with a electric beam that do not cross each others area.

#Features <br>
*dots can be selected with a mouse click <br>
*selected dots can move with arrow keys <br>
*changeable dot creation
 
#Known Bugs
lines cross each other <br>
(as far as I know)

#Planned Things
fix the damn lines <br>
modify dots to sprite modules <br>
moving player maybe <br>
