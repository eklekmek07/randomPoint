# randomPoint
It is a fun project, I mean literally fun. Yet, someday, it will be a engine for my own(eklekmek07) tablegame(that does not exist for know) and my trader game(which is exist but does not work properly)

Project start with a idea that can we create random dots with a electric beam that do not cross each others area.

#Keys<br>
P make lines between selected dots<br>
mouse1 select/unselect dots<br>
C create random dot<br>
arrowkeys to move selected dots

#Features <br>
*dots can be selected with a mouse click <br>
*selected dots can move with arrow keys <br>
*changeable dot creation <br>
*
 
#Known Bugs <br>
lines cross each other (intersection function does not work properly)<br>

#Planned Things <br>
fix the damn lines <br>
modify dots to sprite modules <br>
moving player maybe <br>
